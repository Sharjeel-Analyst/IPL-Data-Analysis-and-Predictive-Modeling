## IPL Data Analysis & Predictive Modeling

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (Final_Code_Aug28.ipynb) that explores IPL (Indian Premier League) ball-by-ball match data and applies machine learning models to extract insights and make predictions.

# Project Overview

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on IPL datasets.

Visualize key insights using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

Apply feature engineering and data preprocessing.

Train and evaluate predictive models including:

Random Forest Classifier

XGBoost Classifier

Measure performance with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

# Datase"

The project uses IPL datasets, primarily:

deliveries.csv
Matches.csv 

You can download the dataset(s) from Kaggle – IPL Dataset


# Installation & Requirements

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Required Libraries

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

xgboost

scipy

 Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Final_Code_Aug28.ipynb


Ensure deliveries.csv and matches.csv is placed in the working directory.

Run the cells step by step to:

Explore IPL data.

Visualize match & player statistics.

Train and evaluate ML models.

# Results

Feature importance from Random Forest and XGBoost.

Performance comparison across models.

Insights into IPL matches from EDA.

# Future Work

To add more features like player injury and Venue
Also should make good dashboards to broadcast
